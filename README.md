Mobile app development with Flutter is rising in the world with a fast pace. Many  company are using this new technology for competitive advantage.

Flutter is a cross-platform UI toolkit that is designed to allow code reuse across operating systems such as iOS and Android, while also allowing applications to interface directly with underlying platform services. The goal is to enable developers to deliver high-performance apps that feel natural on different platforms, embracing differences where they exist while sharing as much code as possible.

Flutter enables you to develop mobile, web and desktop apps using the same codebase and Firebase is the backend as a service for data storage and heavy-duty computational processing which empowers all the online and offline features provided by your apps.
